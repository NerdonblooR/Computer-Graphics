For the 3D modulue construction part, the method is pretty much the same as the one for assignment1.
The body is served as the root of kinematic tree , head is the parent of neck, arm is the parent of elbow,
shoulder is the parent of arm . In order to keep code short, a helper function is used to reduce the redundancy of drawing 
both side of legs and arms.

For implementing different  redering styles, a helper function is used to set up different rendering style based on the 
selected option. For wireframe option , polygonmode should be set to gl_line and for solid option the polygonmode should be set
to gl_fill.  Solid with outline style is difficult,  an offset need to be set in order to make solid elements have a larger depth,
otherwise line elements will be blocked by solid elemets. If shiny metal style is chosen, then the shininess of robot's material should be as high as 
possible. If matte style is chosen , then shininess of the material should be as low as possible.

By updating keyframes, an animation is created to illustrate the implementation of light and DOF.
