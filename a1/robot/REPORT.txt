The first thing I do is to estimate the size (including length and width)of each part of the robot.
These predefined sizes make it much more convinient to do translation and scaling.

When referring to the actual drawing part, the transformation always starts with translation to 
the position of joint(for the convinience of rotation ). By setting the center of the body to be
the actual origin, the position of joints associate with heads and legs can be described in terms
of the width and length of the body. After the translation is done, the next step is scaling the 
coordinates with the size of the part to be drawn. Finally, the polygon of that part is drawn in
this new coordinates. The sequence of drawing follows one principle which is drawing bottom part first. 

For the animation part, some parts of the robot rotate together. For example,
head, eyes and neck. In order to keep the consistency of each part during
animation, all these parts must be drawn in the same coordinate. If some of them
have animation as well(hand or forearm), then this animation is also described 
with respect to the same coordinate.
